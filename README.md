<h2>Project Purpose</h2>
    <h3>The purpose of our project is to assist students or other readers in ifnding a new interesting book. Our website has lists for people to choose from, with a brief summary, as well as a button for people to read mroe if they are interested. Users can rate books and talk about books as well if they enjoyed a certain read. We also provide links to useful outside sources that can help people find new books, or where to find books they want to read.</h3>
     
  <h2>Project History </h2>
     <h3>Everything from our commits, journals, videos, and tasks can be found in the READme box below. At the very bottom will be the first weeks, and the top being the most recent. On the very top, you can also find more details about our individual contributions and tasks beyond simple coding. Our journals are a great way to learn about the details for each day as well as AP exam preparation material.</h3>

  <h1>Reflection/Retrospective</h1>
  <h3>What went well?</h3>
  
Completing all assignments and finding times outside of school to work together if we couldnâ€™t find time to do it in class. Generally, the majority of our group maintained reliable communication, which allowed us to efficiently get work done and finish with time to spare. Also, as long as a task is assigned, most members of the team tried our best to get the task done, even when it means asking for help and assistance from the teachers or other classmates.

  <h3>What didn't go that well?</h3>
  
Sometimes we would have trouble working as a team and collaborating and would kind of do our own thing. If we communicated with each other more often, then we probably could have completed tasks quicker and more in depth. We also could have asked more questions to the teacher as well as other groups. In the future, one of our goals is to have better communication in class. Although we were able to have steady communication, we definitely did not maintain frequent conversations. This would lead to troubles with the code (committs and pushes) and backtrack our progress. 
  
  <h3>What did every team member learn?</h3>
  
Yolanda: I learned that it's important to be patient and keep on trying. There are many times where a code I wrote didn't work the first time, and I would have to then re-read every line and every letter to find out what went wrong. Often, that meant many re-runs and hours spent on one code. Also, I recognized that it's important to hold teammates accountable. Sometimes, I would pick up the slack of those who aren't doing their work, which proved costly to my other academic classes. Next trimester, one of my goals is to make sure that everyone gets their work done in a timely manner.
  
Stanley: I learned that not everything can be accomplished on the first try, but if you keep workign towards it eventually you can figure it out. For example, when I was working on the binary lab for greyscale, I tried many different methods for a long time to make a button, and for a long time I couldn't figure it out. However, after looking online and seekign help, I was finally able to finisih it.
  
Tianbin: I learned something about the coding and also I learned that it is nessesary to try the thing what we learned, and never give up. It is also important to ask if we have some troubles about coding. And also It is important to work together as a team. Comunication is important and also nessesary. 
  
Justin:
  Throughout the course of this class we've learned many things. For example, I've learned how to do loops, if else commands, and much more. All of these topics are very useful topics to go over when in a coding class. Without these skills I don't believe I would be able to do coding at all.
  <h3>What puzzles every team member?</h3>
  
Yolanda: Something that puzzles me is the future of this course. For the next trimester, will we be building another website, or will we have a heavier focus on the AP exam? As the exam nears, it would make more sense to dedicate more time in class to make sure that everyone can pass the AP exam with 4's and 5's
  
Stanley: I am puzzled about how to deploy our website using rasberry pi or the amazon thing. I wonder how we will keep our website running online, and if there will be any maintainence and changes that we make in the future.
  
Tianbin: For me, I puzzled about what we will learn on the next trimester, I know that I still have a lot need to learn, and also I have some questions about the coding and how to finshish my idea about our website.
  
Justin: In this class there were many things that puzzled me. I worked hard to overcome them and for the most part I did. But one of the most challenging things for me was trying to understand the RGB topics. Implementing images and changing the hues and shades on them was very difficult for me to understand.

<h1>Week 4 Progress</h1>
General focus: this week our group focused on forming our website and bring our wireframe to life. We also learned about binary and took individual notes on the subject

<h3>Self Grades + explanations</h3>

Yolanda- 2/2; this week, instead of solely focusing on coding, I shifted my attention to helping my teammates understand our agenda. Stanley and Tianbin simply needed me to assist them with what to do and my expectations, while Justin needed a little bit more help with understanding how the code works and catching up by watching some videos on CB. While doing that, I was also the person who updated the readme with necessary content, added new issues to the scrum board and provided tangibles for all of them, and I did coding for the website (fixing nav bar, implementing new fonts, adding ASCII to binary, starting on RBG)

Tianbin-self grades for me: 1.5 /2, because i have problem about the update program this week, and It waste my time to try to fix it, and I only did the background and other things, so I think I can get 75 percent of the self grades(1.5)

(Comment by Yolanda); personally, I think Tianbin deserves a 1.75-2/2. Tianbin did have some problems with his programs, but I liked that he took initiative and asked Mr. M for help. Also, Tianbin was actively trying to perfect the code in what I wanted him to do. In the beginning of the week, we were having some trouble with the background colors. Tianbin has figured out how to extend the background color to the whole page, and is planning on changing different pages to different colors in the next week.

Justin- (comment by Yolanda, Justin is currently camping) 1.75/2; Justin is still somewhat behind, but I can see that he has made efforts this week to catch up and get some work done. First, he participated in TPT and watching the collegeboard videos, which means he has some knowledge going into coding. I hope he can apply what he learns to our project and be a valuable team member. Justing also took the initiative to meet with Mr. M to catch up with his code on IntelliJ and kindly asked about ASCII for the rest of the group. Overall, it seems that Justin is trending in the right direction, and hopefully in a week or two he will seamlessly transition into the core work of the group.

Stanley-self grade; 1.5/2, because I started off the week by completing Popular Now tab, but toward sthe end of the week I had a lot of trouble with getting my greet code to work. I probably shuold have moved on to other tasks, rather than staying stuck on something I had trouble with.

(Comment by Yolanda); I do agree with the score that Stanley has given himself. While I acknowledge that he could've moved on to other tasks, I wished that he could ask for help from either our cross-over team or another knowledgeable student in the classroom. I also wished that Stanley could be more active in trying to get a "groove" to the website. We really wanted our page to resemble a search engine, and I wished that he had done more research to get to his goals.
